# Python for Data Analysis - Learning Journey

**Goal:** Build foundation for ML engineering career
**Start Date:** 10/17/2025
**Current Progress:** Chapter 3, Section 3.3

## Learning Approach
- Daily 5AM deep work sessions (~2 hours, >= 90 mins min)
- Section-by-section reading + practice problems
- Focus on deliberate practice over speed

## Stats This Week 
- Concepts learned: 8
- Practice problems attempted: 1
- Solved independently: 0 (0%)
- Solved independently or with hints: 1 (100%)  
- Code commits: 1

## Recent Wins
- [10/21/2025]: First day completing an easy, medium, and hard Claude-generated coding problem
- [10/22/2025]: Learned about generators, iterables, and exception handling and understood it
- [10/24/2025]: Complted hard coding problem that required using recursion and multiple conditional requirements

## Current Focus
Open() with encoding, file modes (r/w/x/a/b), with statement for automatic cleanup, read/write methods (read/readlines/write/writelines), text vs binary mode
