# Python for Data Analysis - Learning Journey

**Goal:** Build foundation for ML engineering career
**Start Date:** 10/17/2025
**Current Progress:** Chapter 3, Section 3.2

## Learning Approach
- Daily 5AM deep work sessions (~2 hours, >= 90 mins min)
- Section-by-section reading + practice problems
- Focus on deliberate practice over speed

## Stats This Week 
- Concepts learned: 27
- Practice problems attempted: 7
- Solved independently: 6 (86%)
- Code commits: 3

## Recent Wins
- [10/19/2025]: Continued with my deep work sessions despite getting little sleep
- [10/20/2025]: Implemented using Claude to generate practice conceptual and coding problems
- [10/21/2025]: First day completing an easy, medium, and hard Claude-generated coding problem

## Current Focus
Working through data structures (lists, dicts, sets, tuples)
